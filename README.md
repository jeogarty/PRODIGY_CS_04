My forth task as an intern at Prodigy InfoTech.

Task Title: Simple Keylogger

Task Description: Create a basic keylogger program that records and logs keystrokes. Focus on logging the keys pressed and saving them to a file. Note: Ethical considerations and permissions are crucial for projects involving keyloggers.

Prerequisite: Python 3.x: If you don't have Python installed yet, you can download it from python.org.

Installation: Clone or download this repository, compile and run the program.

Key Features:
1.	Logging Keystrokes: Captures all keystrokes, including alphanumeric characters, spaces, and special keys.
2.	File Output: Saves the keystrokes to a file named keylog.txt in the current directory.
3.	Exit Mechanism: Stops the keylogger when the Escape key is pressed.
   
Usage:
1.	Install the required library:
bash
Copy code
pip install pynput
2.	Save the script to a .py file and run it.

Important Notes:
•	Legal and Ethical Use: Keyloggers can be used maliciously to capture sensitive information. Use this script only for educational purposes or to monitor your own devices with proper consent.
•	Antivirus Detection: Keylogger programs may trigger antivirus alerts because of their potential misuse.
